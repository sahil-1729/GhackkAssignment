# Frontend Pricing Page

This React app displays pricing plans fetched from the backend `/pricing` API. It demonstrates blue-green deployment routing.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the app:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

The app will proxy `/pricing` requests to the backend server.
